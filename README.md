# socialnetworkapi

## Description
The socialnetworkapi is a robust API tailored for social network web applications, enabling users to share their thoughts, interact with friends' thoughts, and manage friend lists seamlessly. This backend solution utilizes a NoSQL database powered by MongoDB, with Express.js for efficient routing and Mongoose ODM for handling vast amounts of unstructured data. It includes User and Thought models with defined schemas, along with a Reaction subdocument schema to manage user reactions effectively. Upon invocation, the server initializes, and Mongoose models synchronize with the MongoDB database, ensuring smooth operation.
